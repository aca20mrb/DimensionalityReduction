Within this directory are a variety of different python files, each performing a certain task
They are named after the dataset to which they are using; iris, wine, housing and optical
There are 2 general file cases:

_reductions: These are the main files used to obtain performance results
_comparisons: These were experimental files used to determine optimal parameters of n and k

Further Variations include files with formatting _rand
This was a later addition which involves calculating the Rand Index for each clustering

There are some further files, notably:
explore-datasets: Opens samples of each dataset explored
filter_optical_labels: Ensures the correct order of the sample labels for the optical dataset
plot_eyes: A non-reduced plot of the average of each cluster obtained from the optical dataset
